we could have 

1) invansive probe: probe calls would be littered throughout the 
code and would assume users would have access to source code.

1) non-invansive probe: would have to have the client already sending
enough information and provide adapting accessor functions, a somewhat
unrealistic situation.

Because we do have the code, and the measurements that we want
to make are specific (ie, we want to know the difference in time
between when the call to show the frame is made and when the
frame is actually shown), we will proceed with the invasive 
approach, carefully labelling each specific location and
type of probing being used.

we must be able to clarify the scope of determinants and non-determinants
we must also be able to discern on what level what kind of information can
be gleaned.

determinants 
- what frame is shown
- the level the

non-determinants: 
- avg and std dev of time that the frame is shown, when
all is well.
- avg and std dev of communication discrepency between the WF and
the clients
