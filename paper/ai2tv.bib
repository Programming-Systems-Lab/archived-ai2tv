  abstract =     {The components of a loosely-coupled system are typically
                  designed to operate by generating and responding to
                  asynchronous events.  An \emph{event notification
                  service} is an application-independent
                  infrastructure that supports the construction of
                  event-based systems, whereby generators of events
                  publish event notifications to the infrastructure
                  and consumers of events subscribe with the
                  infrastructure to receive relevant notifications.
                  The two primary services that should be provided to
                  components by the infrastructure are notification
                  selection (i.e., determining which notifications
                  match which subscriptions) and notification delivery
                  (i.e, routing matching notifications from publishers
                  to subscribers).  Numerous event notification
                  services have been developed for local-area
                  networks, generally based on a centralized server to
                  select and deliver event notifications.  Therefore,
                  they suffer from an inherent inability to scale to
                  wide-area networks, such as the Internet, where the
                  number and physical distribution of the service's
                  clients can quickly overwhelm a centralized
                  solution.  The critical challenge in the setting of
                  a wide-area network is to maximize the
                  expressiveness in the selection mechanism without
                  sacrificing scalability in the delivery mechanism.

                  This paper presents \emph{Siena}, an event
                  notification service that we have designed and
                  implemented to exhibit both expressiveness and
                  scalability.  We describe the service's interface to
                  applications, the algorithms used by networks of
                  servers to select and deliver event notifications,
                  and the strategies used to optimize performance.  We
                  also present results of simulation studies that
                  examine the scalability and performance of the
                  service.}
