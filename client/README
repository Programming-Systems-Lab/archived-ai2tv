- add the c:\java1.4\jre\bin\client\ (directory holding jvm.dll) to
  your path.  

- go to the propertes page of the project and add the library
  (c:\java1.4\lib\jvm.lib) there.
- add to 
  >tools>options>projects>vc++ build dirs> 
  include dir: 
    add java1.4/include
        java1.4/include/win32
        c:\pslroot\psl\chime\client94\jni
  execute dir: 
    add java1.4/jre/bin/client

  > environment path 
    c:\pslroot\psl\ai2tv\client (this is for the java lib dir)

to get the picture flowing: 

1) start up Siena, I used (siena-1.4.3.jar has to be in your classpath):

> java siena.StartServer -ka -err - -log - -port 4444

2) start the client/video player.  A screen will come up waiting for your 
commands.  Note that without Siena, this player is useless.

> java psl.ai2tv.client.Client

3) Start the WF.  

> java psl.ai2tv.client.FauxWF ka:localhost:4444

NOTES:

- it's bad, in some places, like the client, I have some things hard
  wired, like the Siena server, web address of the frame files, etc.

- you NEED to have my new frame_index.txt file, where there are four
  rows for each frame file.  The fourth one is the length of the file.
  You can either check out the file I have in the psl/ai2tv/client dir,
  or create it with FIP.java.

for the hierarchy up and down functions, here is my reasoning: 

hiearchy down (lower number of frames)
  measurement: int lateFrames


hiearchy up (higher number of frames)
  measurement:  int earlyFrames


(note, ideally, these are measurements that the probe should be making...so are 
we cheating by having the cache controller make the measurements?  is there another
way?)

- this might even be a decision made internally.
