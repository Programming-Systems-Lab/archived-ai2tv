[BucketPG]
doc=representation of a gauge sample
slots=long sampleTime, Vector group
sampleTime.doc=moment of the sample
group.doc=set of clients in the same group and sampled; includes ClientAsset instances

[ClientPG]
doc=representation of an A2TV client as sampled
slots=String id, String host, int level, int cacheLevel, int frameRate, double bandwidth, long sampleTime, int prefetchedFrames, int reserveFrames, double avgDistWF2Client, int penalties, boolean adapt, int newFrameRate
id.doc=unique client ID
host.doc=host name
level.doc=client's last measured level
frameRate.doc=client's last measured frame rate
cacheLevel.doc=client cache's last measured level
reserveFrames.doc=number of reserved frames if the client and cache levels are not the same
bandwidth.doc=last bandwidth measure
sampleTime.doc=moment of the sample - same as the equivalent field in BucketPG
prefetchedFrames.doc=the number of frames downloaded ahead of time
avgDistWF2Client.doc=the average propagation delay measured from the WF to the client
penalties.doc=the number of various penalties that this client has incurred
adapt.doc=indicates whether this client needs to be adjusted
newFrameRate.doc=the new frame rate to go to

[FramePG]
doc=representation of a downloaded video frame
slots=int level, int num, int start, int end, long timeShown, int timeOffset, long timeDownloaded
level.doc=hierarchy level
num.doc=frame number
start.doc=start of the represented frame interval
end.doc=end of the represented frame interval
timeShown=video clock time when the frame was shown
timeOffset=time offset at which the frame was shown (0 is right on time, negative values are early)
timeDownloaded=video clock time when the frame was downloaded
